**This project was an old idea that I had during colege in 2009, today there are several techinologies build for that purpose such as [pjax](https://github.com/MoOx/pjax) and [turbolinks](https://github.com/rails/turbolinks/).**

BALAH stands for Bookmarkable Ajax Links And HTTP, it is a new technique that enable asynchronous contents to be indexable and navigable -- this includes Back and Forward support for ajax actions -- in any browser with or without JavaScript?. The sjax content also became easy to index in search engines!

BALAH means to turn synchronous links to asynchronous hashes on-the-fly, the state of the page is saved in window.location.hash. To manipulate and navigate through the States of the page we Use HashListener 2.0 which is part of this project.

BALAH is very simple and straight approach, based in the following:

* Server side script to build synchronous links, content is synchronous
* Client side script to turn synchronous links into asynchronous. content became asynchronous
* HashListener 2.0 make asynchronous content navigable in different browsers
* Every thing can be adapted to fit existent frameworks and add uninterrupted AJAX support. 

*This project is too old and there is no longer a demo*
