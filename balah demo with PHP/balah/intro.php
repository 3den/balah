<p><b>Balah</b> is a technique to solve the navigability problems of the Web 2.0,
and make asynchronous contents visible and indexable even without JavaScript.<br/>
<b>Balah</b> means to make web applications compatible and usable in any ambient (browser),  Since the application is made to work in both ways, synchronous and asynchronous.

This site is a demo of <b>Balah</b>.
Here you can see that Balah Links only became asynchronous on-the-Fly.
they use the hash "#" to save and change the states of the page. HashListener 2.0 make it compatible diferent browsers, and when the browser is not compatible to JavaScript the page works synchronously.

<br>you can download <a href="./libs/">here</a> the libs builded to make this happens.
