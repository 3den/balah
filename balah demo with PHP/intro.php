<p><b>BALAH</b> is a technique to solve the navigability problems of the Web 2.0,
and make asynchronous contents visible and indexable even without JavaScript.
<b>BALAH</b> means to make web applications functional navigable and usable in any ambient (browser),  Since the application is made to work in both ways, synchronous and asynchronous.

This site is a demo of <b>BALAH</b>.
Here you can see that BALAH Links only became asynchronous on-the-Fly.
they use the hash "#" to save and change the states of the page. HashListener 2.0 make it compatible diferent browsers, and when the browser is not compatible to JavaScript the page works synchronously.
<br>you can download <a href="./libs/">here</a> the libs builded to make this happens.

This sample is builded using <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com">JQuery</a>. It serves to study the principles of BALAH. you can download this demo <a href="./balah_demo_with_PHP_and_JQUERY.zip">here.</a>
